🔬 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
A mini project developed as part of the curriculum at Bangalore Technological Institute, under the Department of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. This web-based application helps predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical input parameters using a trained machine learning model.

💡 Project Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes using a machine learning model trained on a medical dataset. The user inputs several health-related parameters, and the model returns a prediction indicating the likelihood of diabetes.
The final product is a Flask web app with a user-friendly frontend interface, allowing real-time predictions.
